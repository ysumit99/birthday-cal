# Birthday Cal

## Filling Cards with equal size squares

Lets take for exmaple any card, lets assume Monday. 
If 'N' people have their birthdays on Monday.
No. of equal sized grids to be made can be calculated by
getting the nearest perfect square, greater than or equal to 'N'.

example: Assume there are 7 people with their birthdays on Monday.

What should be the size of the grid ?

perfect square nearest to 7 is 9. so a grid of 3X3 is to be made before actually filling the card.
